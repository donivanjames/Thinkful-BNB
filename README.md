# Thinkfulbnb

Thinkfulbnb is a <b>mock</b> vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. 
<br><br>
Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

This was one of my first Thinkful assignments, way before we'd ever even heard of React.<br><br>
For this assignment, I implemented Thinkfulbnb's landing page in HTML, using bootstrap and flexbot for the CSS. <br>
Followed a mobile-first development approach. Images and fields will scale with screen size.
